# RSS Feed Reader Redesigned

The feed reader script started as a personal project to integrate news headlines in a `conky` configuration. A couple of years later, I've redesigned it as a standalone application with streamlined ETL (extract-transform-load) pipeline. Now, it's ready for the next logical step: *asynchronous pipelines*.

## Install

In order to install this utility, copy the reader and parser scripts to your `$PATH` (preferably to `~/bin` or `~/.local/bin`) and don't forget to install the dependencies.

## Dependencies

This script utility depends on `curl`, `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, [`W3C HTML and XML manipulation utilities`](https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/README) and programs like `cut`, `tr`, etc. from GNU coreutils. To install these on a Debian based distribution run following

```sh
sudo apt install curl gawk sed html-xml-utils
```



## Usage

The standard usage is like

```sh
reader url | FILE
```

It can be invoked for a single URL or a file containing multiple URL one-per-line. The `parsefeed` script reads the cached feed files generated by the reader. The standard usage for the parser is like

```sh
parsefeed [n] [MAX_LENGTH]
```

where `n` is number of headings per feed to print, (defaults to 5) and pass a second argument to truncate headlines longer than `MAX_LENGTH` number characters.

An example URL file is included in the repo.
