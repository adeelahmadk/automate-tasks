## Install

In order to install this utility, copy the reader and parser scripts to your `$PATH` (preferably to `~/bin` or `~/.local/bin`) and don't forget to install the dependencies.

## Dependencies

This script utility depends on `curl`, `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, [`W3C HTML and XML manipulation utilities`](https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/README) and programs like `cut`, `tr`, etc. from GNU coreutils. To install these on a Debian based distribution run following

```sh
sudo apt install curl gawk sed html-xml-utils
```



## Usage

The standard usage is like

```sh
rssreader url | FILE
```

It can be invoked for a single URL or a file containing multiple URL one-per-line. The `parsefeed` script reads the cached feed files generated by the reader. The standard usage for the parser is like

```sh
parse_feeds dir [count]
```

where `dir` is the path to the directory containing feed files and `count` is number of headings per feed to print. If second argument is not passed, then the default count of 5 headings is used.

An example URL file is included in the repo.
